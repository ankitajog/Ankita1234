3.Query:
create database std_db;
use std_db;
create table std_tbl(id int primary key, name varchar(20),class varchar(5));
desc std_tbl;
insert into std_tbl values(1,'Alice','fycs'),(2,'Bob','sycs'),(3,'Smith','tycs');
select * from std_tbl;
create table game_tbl(roll_no int  , game varchar(20),foreign key(roll_no) references std_tbl(id)) ;
desc game_tbl;
insert into game_tbl(roll_no,game) values(1,'Cricket'),(1,'KhoKho'),(2,'Cricket'),(3,'khokho');
select * from game_tbl;
